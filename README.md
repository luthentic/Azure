### Physical:
Layer that deals with all the physical aspects of data transmission

**Data Representation:** It determines how the binary data (1s and 0s) is represented physically. For example, these bits could be represented as voltage levels, light pulses, or radio waves.

**Media and Connectors:** Itâ€™s concerned with the physical medium for data transmission. This could be cables (like Ethernet cables or fiber optics) or wireless media (like radio waves).

**Signal Transmission:** It manages how signals are transmitted. For instance, it determines whether the transmission is simplex (one-way), half-duplex (two-way but not at the same time), or full-duplex (two-way and simultaneous).

**Hardware:** It involves hardware equipment like routers, switches, hubs, modems, and network interface cards (NICs).

Network** Topology:** It also deals with the physical layout of the devices on the network, known as the network topology. This could be a star topology, bus topology, ring topology, etc.
